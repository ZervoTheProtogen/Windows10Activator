# Windows10Activator

We all think that a copy of windows 10 is ridiculously expensive, right? Like i just want to re-install windows and now i have to buy it again because i don't have the key?
Or maybe regular activation just doesn't work? Whatever it is, this tool will activate windows 10 for you free of charge! Just download the latest release, run the program
and select release and server, click a button and done! No more annoying watermark or restricted customizability.

## Quick words

Before you use this i just want to make sure you understand that i am not responsible for any legal trouble you might get in. Microsoft can't trace this (unless you
download it from edge i guess) but i'm pretty sure it's towards TOS. With that said i don't care what you do with this, as long as you don't try to blame the consequences
on me, because it was you who decided to do something and not me, i just made the tool

## Usage

Using a release is pretty straight forward, just download a release, extract it and launch the file called Windows10Activator.exe.

Building a release is also pretty simple. Just use a python exe compiler of your choice (i used [auto-py-to-exe](https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe)). Make sure to include the icon and the activate.bat file.
I will provide more detailed instructions in the future but if you run into any issues before then feel free to open a new issue or contact me.
